mkvmaker is a simple bash scrip utilizing mplayer, mencoder, mkvmerge, and
mkvpropedit to convert a source VOB video file (assumed from an NTSC DVD)
to a quality matroska .mkv file with x264 compressed video, MP3 or AAC
compressed stereo audio, and preserved AC3 Dolby surround audio.

This tool is designed around my personal preferences for a/v quality,
portability, and file size. It works effectively on its own for me maybe
90% of the time, but there are plenty of oddball edge cases where I have
to manually tweak with things to get the final mkv file just right (i.e.,
funky subtitles, weird audio tracks, nonstandard frame rates, etc). For
that reason, there is a -T flag to display all of the script commands
without actually executing them.

Good luck, and feedback and collaboration are highly encouraged!

v0.97 -- Added the -b flag to increase the video bitrate for high
definition input (bluray). Also moved the probe crop out of a function
and changed the syntax so that the probe command will display when doing
a -T test run.
